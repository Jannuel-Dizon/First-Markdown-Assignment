The data I would like to use would be coming from apps like Google maps and Waze that show us where there are traffic and how to avoid them. Knowing where the traffic start  we can then check that place and analyse what could be the underlying issue would be, rather than relying on road widening. The Statistical method that will be utilized here would be Prescriptive analysis. Anyone who travels could benefit from this because of the reduced travel time if it will be implemented properly.")

Data science could be used to understand the patterns of trending art and how these trends form. This could also be useful to art professionals and musicians who would want to understand why art and music differs from traditional art and music. Culture studies could benefit from data science because it gives another way to show how our culture of art and music is evolving from previous forms")
